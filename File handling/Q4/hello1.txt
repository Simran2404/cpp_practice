While many of us have been forced to at least try to understand 
what an NFT is over the last year or so, the latest figures from 
Google Trends suggest that this research has not led to a sustained 
interest in the topic. 
For those that haven't as yet attempted to get to grips with the phenomenon, 
here's Wikipedia to the rescue: "A non-fungible token (NFT) is a non-interchangeable 
unit of data stored on a blockchain, a form of digital ledger, that can be sold and traded. 
Types of NFT data units may be associated with digital files such as photos, videos, and audio."
