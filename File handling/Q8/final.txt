letter case is generally applied in a mixedcase fashion
with both upper and lowercase letters appearing in a given
piece of text for legibility The choice of case is often 
prescribed by the grammar of a language or by the conventions 
of a particular discipline in orthography the uppercase is 
primarily reserved for special purposes such as the first 
letter of a sentence or of a proper noun called capitalisation
or capitalised words which makes the lowercase the more common variant in regular text
